1- Check if ith of x bit is 1: x & (1<<(i-1)) > 0
2- Check if ith of x bit is 0: x & (1<<(i-1)) == 0
3- Get the value of last bit(LSB) of x: x&1
4- Set ith bit of x to 1: x = x | (1<<(i-1))
5- Set ith bit of x to 0: x = x & ~(1<<(i-1))
6- Set last set bit(1 bit) to 0: x = x & (x-1)
7- Set last 0 bit to 1: x = x | (x+1)
